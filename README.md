# midi to mlog
A python script to convert midi files into mindustry schematics.

The schematics use `playsound` with world processors to play the song.

## usage
  To run the script you'll need the `pymsch` and `mido` libraries installed.

  Then to use the script just run it with some command line arguments, use `--help` to get started.

## known issues
  Needs a proper soundfont, most notes are just `@sfx-press`, and a lot of percussion is excluded.
